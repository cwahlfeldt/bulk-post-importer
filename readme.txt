Import posts and custom post types from JSON files with intelligent field mapping for WordPress fields, ACF, and custom meta.

== Description ==

The Bulk Post Importer streamlines the process of importing large amounts of content into WordPress from JSON data sources. Whether you're migrating from another platform, importing data from APIs, or bulk-creating content, this plugin provides a user-friendly interface with advanced mapping capabilities.

= Key Features =

* **Multi-format Support**: Import any public post type (posts, pages, custom post types)
* **Intelligent Field Mapping**: Visual interface for mapping JSON keys to WordPress fields
* **ACF Integration**: Full support for Advanced Custom Fields with automatic field detection
* **Gutenberg Ready**: Automatically converts text content to Gutenberg paragraph blocks
* **Custom Meta Fields**: Support for standard WordPress custom fields (post meta)
* **Secure Processing**: Built-in security checks and data validation
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and import logging
* **Performance Optimized**: Efficient processing for large datasets

= What It Does =

This plugin takes a JSON file containing an array of objects and creates WordPress posts from that data. Each object in the JSON array becomes a new post, with the ability to map JSON properties to:

* **Standard WordPress Fields**: Title, content, excerpt, status, date, etc.
* **ACF Fields**: Any Advanced Custom Fields assigned to the target post type
* **Custom Meta**: Standard WordPress post meta fields

= Supported JSON Format =

`[
  {
    "title": "Your Post Title",
    "content": "Your post content here",
    "excerpt": "Post excerpt",
    "status": "publish",
    "custom_field": "Custom value",
    "acf_field": "ACF value"
  },
  {
    "title": "Another Post",
    "content": "More content"
  }
]`

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.0 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* Users need `manage_options` capability (typically Administrators)
* Optional: Advanced Custom Fields plugin for ACF field mapping

**ACF Fields (if ACF is active)**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What JSON format is supported? =

The plugin expects a JSON file containing an array of objects. Each object represents one post to be imported. The objects can have any properties, which you'll map to WordPress fields during the import process.

= Does this work with custom post types? =

Yes! The plugin works with any public post type registered in WordPress, including custom post types created by themes or other plugins.

= Can I import ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) data? =

Absolutely! If you have the ACF plugin installed, the importer will automatically detect all ACF field groups assigned to your target post type and allow you to map JSON data to those fields.

= What happens if the import fails? =

The plugin provides detailed error reporting. If an import fails, you'll see exactly which items failed and why. Successfully imported items are not rolled back, so you can fix issues and re-run the import for failed items.

= Is there a file size limit? =

The plugin can handle reasonably large files, but very large files may be limited by PHP settings like `upload_max_filesize` and `max_execution_time`. We recommend keeping files under 10MB for optimal performance.

= Can I import images and media? =

Currently, the plugin imports text-based data. For images, you would need to upload them separately and reference them by attachment ID in your JSON data for ACF image fields.

= Does it work with Gutenberg blocks? =

Yes! Text content is automatically converted to Gutenberg paragraph blocks. Each line in your content becomes a separate paragraph block.
