# Bulk Post Importer

A powerful WordPress plugin that allows you to bulk import posts and custom post types from JSON files with intelligent field mapping for standard WordPress fields, Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), and custom meta fields.

## Description

The Bulk Post Importer streamlines the process of importing large amounts of content into WordPress from JSON data sources. Whether you're migrating from another platform, importing data from APIs, or bulk-creating content, this plugin provides a user-friendly interface with advanced mapping capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Import any public post type (posts, pages, custom post types)
- **Intelligent Field Mapping**: Visual interface for mapping JSON keys to WordPress fields
- **ACF Integration**: Full support for Advanced Custom Fields with automatic field detection
- **Gutenberg Ready**: Automatically converts text content to Gutenberg paragraph blocks
- **Custom Meta Fields**: Support for standard WordPress custom fields (post meta)
- **Secure Processing**: Built-in security checks and data validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and import logging
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient processing for large datasets

### What It Does

This plugin takes a JSON file containing an array of objects and creates WordPress posts from that data. Each object in the JSON array becomes a new post, with the ability to map JSON properties to:

- **Standard WordPress Fields**: Title, content, excerpt, status, date, etc.
- **ACF Fields**: Any Advanced Custom Fields assigned to the target post type
- **Custom Meta**: Standard WordPress post meta fields

### Supported JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Your Post Title",
    "content": "Your post content here",
    "excerpt": "Post excerpt",
    "status": "publish",
    "custom_field": "Custom value",
    "acf_field": "ACF value"
  },
  {
    "title": "Another Post",
    "content": "More content"
  }
]
```

## Installation

### From WordPress Admin (Recommended)

1. Download the plugin zip file
2. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard
3. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**
4. Click **Upload Plugin**
5. Choose the downloaded zip file and click **Install Now**
6. Click **Activate Plugin**

### Manual Installation

1. Download and extract the plugin files
2. Upload the `bulk-json-importer` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Go to **Plugins** in your WordPress admin
4. Find "Bulk Post Importer" and click **Activate**

### Requirements

- **WordPress**: 5.0 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.4 or higher
- **Permissions**: Users need `manage_options` capability (typically Administrators)
- **Optional**: Advanced Custom Fields plugin for ACF field mapping

## Usage

### Step 1: Access the Importer

1. Go to **Tools > Bulk Post Importer** in your WordPress admin
2. You'll see the upload interface

### Step 2: Upload Your JSON File

1. Click **Choose File** and select your JSON file
2. Select the target **Post Type** from the dropdown
3. Click **Upload and Proceed to Mapping**

### Step 3: Map Your Fields

The mapping interface shows three sections:

#### Standard Fields

Map JSON keys to WordPress core fields:

- **Title** (Required): The post title
- **Content**: Post content (converted to Gutenberg blocks)
- **Excerpt**: Post excerpt
- **Status**: publish, draft, private, etc.
- **Date**: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)

#### ACF Fields (if ACF is active)

- Automatically detects ACF field groups assigned to your post type
- Shows field name, type, and description
- Supports most ACF field types (text, textarea, number, select, etc.)

#### Custom Meta Fields

- Add unlimited custom field mappings
- Specify JSON key and WordPress meta key
- Use for non-ACF post metadata

### Step 4: Process Import

1. Review your field mappings
2. Click **Process Import**
3. View the results page with import statistics and any warnings/errors

## Advanced Usage

### JSON Data Preparation

For best results, ensure your JSON data is:

- **Valid JSON**: Use a JSON validator to check syntax
- **UTF-8 Encoded**: Prevents character encoding issues
- **Consistent Structure**: All objects should have similar properties
- **Reasonable Size**: Large files may require server timeout adjustments

### ACF Field Support

The plugin supports most ACF field types:

- **Basic Fields**: Text, Textarea, Number, Email, URL, Password
- **Content Fields**: Wysiwyg Editor, Oembed, Image, File, Gallery
- **Choice Fields**: Select, Checkbox, Radio Button, True/False
- **Relational Fields**: Link, Post Object, Page Link, Relationship, Taxonomy, User
- **jQuery Fields**: Google Map, Date Picker, Color Picker
- **Layout Fields**: Message, Accordion, Tab, Group

**Note**: Complex fields (Repeater, Gallery, Relationship) require data in ACF's expected format.

### Custom Field Examples

```json
{
  "post_title": "Sample Post",
  "post_content": "This is the content",
  "custom_price": "29.99",
  "custom_category": "electronics",
  "acf_field_key": "value"
}
```

### Performance Tips

- **File Size**: Keep JSON files under 10MB for optimal performance
- **Batch Processing**: For very large datasets, split into multiple files
- **Server Resources**: Increase PHP memory limit and execution time if needed
- **Testing**: Always test with a small subset first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File Upload Errors**

- Check file size limits in PHP settings
- Ensure JSON file is valid and properly formatted
- Verify file permissions

**Import Fails or Times Out**

- Increase PHP memory limit (`memory_limit = 256M`)
- Increase execution time (`max_execution_time = 300`)
- Reduce file size or split into smaller files

**Fields Not Mapping Correctly**

- Check JSON key names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify ACF field groups are assigned to the post type
- Ensure custom field names are valid (alphanumeric and underscores)

**Posts Not Created**

- Verify user has sufficient permissions
- Check that post title is mapped (required field)
- Review error messages in the import log

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, add this to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
```

Check `/wp-content/debug.log` for detailed error information.
